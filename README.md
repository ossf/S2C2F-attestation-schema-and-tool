# **OSCAL CONTENT VALIDATOR**

 Validation of any OSCAL content instance can be accomplished by applying the appropriate schema for the respective format. For example, a System Security Plan (SSP) represented in OSCAL XML can be validated against the SSP XML Schema, which defines (in machinable form) the validation rules for OSCAL SSPs in XML. Validation operations are based entirely on non-proprietary, standardized processes available in multiple tool implementations, by reference to open, publicly available schemas, located in the OSCAL repository for XML and JSON/YAML respectively.

YAML developers should take note that the JSON Schemas can be applied to YAML content instances.

The validator is from NIST OSCAL tool set available at https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/tree/main/src/utils

##
